# The Contract Layer
One can see the .proto files inside the backend/collabTexteditorService directroy 
These files are what provide the contract Layer for this API , which both the frontend 
and backend need to obey.

# Adding A service - 
If one wants to use the several structs created for a feature , they need to use 
a service by declaring an RPC service an example shown below - 

``` 
service SearchService {
  rpc Search(SearchRequest) returns (SearchResponse);
}
```

One can keep multiple .proto files under the same package name , but then 
the autogenerated go code , will all be in one files for all the microservices
supported by your application.

Syntax Used - Proto v3

# Generating the .pb.go files from the proto files.

From the Backend Directory - 

```
protoc \
		-I=$(PROTO_DIR) \
		--go_out=paths=source_relative:$(OUT_DIR) \
		--go-grpc_out=paths=source_relative:$(OUT_DIR) \
		$(PROTO_DIR)/$(PROTO_SRC_2)
```
